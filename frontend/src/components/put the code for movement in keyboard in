put the code for movement in keyboard into app.jsx and pass the row and column to keyboard.jsx .prevent the components from being 
active by just going through the buttons. only when blink command is given while a button is active should the component related to
 that button should be shown. add a back button to the keyboard, when selected should give back the control to the control panel.
  when in keyboard component, all the commands should only affect the keybaord. give me the complete updated code for app.jsx and 
  keyboard.jsx
